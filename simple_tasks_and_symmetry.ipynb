The simplest way is to represent a displacement as an L=1 vector, `Rs=[(1, 1]]`. However, to better illustrate the symmetry properties of the network, we instead are going to use a spherical harmonic signal or more specifically, the peak of the spherical harmonic signal, to signify the displacement of the original point.\n",

    "It's a bit of a complicated story, but at the surface level here it is: [Character tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_table) are handy tabulations of how certain spherical tensor datatypes transform under that group symmetry. The rows are irreducible representations (irrep for short) and the columns are similar elements of the group (called [conjugacy classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class)). Character tables are most commonly seen for finite groups of $E(3)$ symmetry as they are used extensively in solid state physics, crystallography, chemistry, etc. Next to the part of the table with the \"characters\", there are often columns showing linear, quadratic, and cubic functions (meaning they are of order 1, 2, and 3) that transform in the same way as a given irrep.\n",

So, to break all those symmetries that $D_{4h}$ has that $D_{2h}$ DOESN'T have -- we add a non-zero contribution to the $x^2 - y^2$ component of our spherical harmonic tensors.\n",
